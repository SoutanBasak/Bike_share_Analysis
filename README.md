# Bike_share_Analysis

#### This analysis is based on the Divvy case study 
*"'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization"* written by Kevin Hartman  
(found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study).  

The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single dataframe and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question:  
**“In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”**
